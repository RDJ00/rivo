# Rivo Project Deployment Guide

## Local Development Setup
- [x] Node.js (v16.x or later recommended) - v23.9.0 installed
- [x] Package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) - npm v10.9.2 and pnpm v10.7.1 installed
- [x] Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RDJ00/rivo.git` - Already in repository directory
- [x] Install dependencies: `pnpm install` or `npm install` - Completed with pnpm
- [x] Run development server: `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` - Working on http://localhost:3000

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option from next.config.mjs
- [x] Fixed Next.js routing (removed react-router-dom dependency)
- [x] Updated components to use Next.js Link component
- [x] Fixed layout.tsx file to remove duplicate imports

## Prerequisites
- [x] GitHub account for version control - Already linked to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel account for hosting

## Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard (if needed)

## Build Process
- [x] Run linting checks: Skipped (configured to skip in next.config.mjs)
- [x] Run build process: `pnpm build` - Successful
- [x] Test the production build locally: `pnpm start` - Working on http://localhost:3000

## Deployment to Vercel
- [ ] Sign up/Log in to Vercel: https://vercel.com/
- [ ] Import GitHub repository:
  - Click "Add New..." > "Project"
  - Select the GitHub repository (rivo)
  - Authorize Vercel to access the repository if needed
- [ ] Configure project settings:
  - Framework Preset: Next.js (should be auto-detected)
  - Build Command: `next build` (default)
  - Install Command: `pnpm install` 
  - Output Directory: `.next` (default)
- [ ] Add environment variables (if needed)
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for the deployment to complete

## Post-Deployment Tasks
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if needed):
  - Go to project settings > Domains
  - Add your custom domain
  - Configure DNS settings as directed by Vercel
- [ ] Verify deployment works correctly
- [ ] Set up continuous deployment for future updates

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add monitoring or analytics
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Consider performance optimizations
- [ ] Plan for future feature development

## Deployment Options
- [ ] Netlify:
  - Connect GitHub repository
  - Set build command: `npm run build`
  - Set publish directory: `.next`
- [ ] Traditional hosting:
  - Build the project: `npm run build`
  - Deploy the `.next` folder and other static assets

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement authentication if required
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configurations
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Secure environment variables

## Maintenance
- [ ] Implement logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Create backup strategy
- [ ] Plan for regular updates
