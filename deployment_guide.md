# Rivo Project Deployment Guide

## Local Development Setup
- [x] Node.js (v16.x or later recommended) - v23.9.0 installed
- [x] Package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) - npm v10.9.2 and pnpm v10.7.1 installed
- [x] Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RDJ00/rivo.git` - Already in repository directory
- [x] Install dependencies: `pnpm install` or `npm install` - Completed with pnpm
- [x] Run development server: `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` - Working on http://localhost:3000

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option from next.config.mjs
- [x] Fixed Next.js routing (removed react-router-dom dependency)
- [x] Updated components to use Next.js Link component
- [x] Fixed layout.tsx file to remove duplicate imports

## Prerequisites
- [x] GitHub account for version control - Already linked to GitHub
- [ ] Hosting platform account (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Domain name (optional, but recommended for production)

## Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure any API keys needed for third-party services
- [ ] Create .env.local file for local development (and add to .gitignore)

## Build Process
- [x] Run linting checks: Skipped (configured to skip in next.config.mjs)
- [x] Run build process: `pnpm build` - Successful
- [x] Test the production build locally: `pnpm start` - Working on http://localhost:3000

## Next Steps for Deployment
- [ ] Choose a hosting platform (Vercel recommended for Next.js)
- [ ] Push updated code to GitHub
- [ ] Connect hosting platform to GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure deployment settings

## Deployment Options
- [ ] Vercel (recommended for Next.js projects):
  - Connect GitHub repository
  - Configure build settings
  - Set environment variables
- [ ] Netlify:
  - Connect GitHub repository
  - Set build command: `npm run build`
  - Set publish directory: `.next`
- [ ] Traditional hosting:
  - Build the project: `npm run build`
  - Deploy the `.next` folder and other static assets

## Post-Deployment Tasks
- [ ] Set up custom domain
- [ ] Configure SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement authentication if required
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configurations
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Secure environment variables

## Maintenance
- [ ] Implement logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Create backup strategy
- [ ] Plan for regular updates
